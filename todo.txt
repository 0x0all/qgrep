features:
1. incremental update (compare mtime/size, add/remove files, don't recompress chunks unless necessary)
5. vim script
6. stale file support
7. incremental update based on stale file list
8. faster case-insensitive literal matching (one pass read instead of read/lower/write/read)
9. recognize (?i) at the beginning of regular expression as case-insensitive marker (check that it's not toggled off later)
10. linux support
11. search with filename filtering
13. incremental update based on ntfs journal / inotify
14. proper unicode support wrt lowercasing (i.e. sometimes we'll have to revert back to slow casefold using re2)
15. #! support in .cfg files
16. ignore/exclude per folder in .cfg files (groups...)
17. jobified chunk compression in builder
