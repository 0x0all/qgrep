features:
1. incremental update (compare mtime/size, add/remove files, don't recompress chunks unless necessary)
3. unicode conversion for input files
5. vim script
6. stale file support
7. incremental update based on stale file list
8. faster case-insensitive literal matching (one pass read instead of read/lower/write/read)
9. recognize (?i) at the beginning of regular expression as case-insensitive marker (check that it's not toggled off later)
10. linux support
11. search with filename filtering
12. project name support improvement: hierarchical project names (init should create folders), project path instead of name should work
13. incremental update based on ntfs journal / inotify
14. proper unicode support wrt lowercasing (i.e. sometimes we'll have to revert back to slow casefold using re2)
