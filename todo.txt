features:
5. vim script (docs)
6. stale file support
9. recognize (?i) at the beginning of regular expression as case-insensitive marker (check that it's not toggled off later)
13. incremental update based on ntfs journal / fsevents / inotify
14. proper unicode support wrt lowercasing (i.e. sometimes we'll have to revert back to slow casefold using re2, or do utf8 casefold)
15. #! support in .cfg files
17. jobified chunk compression in builder
21. tags
22. optimize lowercasing for short strings (small TLS buffer?)
23. optimize single-character highlighting by constructing a special regex: re -> (re)+ (literal?)
