features:
1. incremental update (compare mtime/size, add/remove files, don't recompress chunks unless necessary)
2. path-sorted output (output gather + memory-efficient writer (i.e. flush results to stdout asap))
3. unicode conversion for input files
4. column numbers in output (optional)
5. vim script
6. stale file support
7. incremental update based on stale file list
8. faster case-insensitive literal matching (one pass read instead of read/lower/write/read)
9. recognize (?i) at the beginning of regular expression as case-insensitive marker (check that it's not toggled off later)
10. linux support
11. search with filename filtering

bugs:
1. resolve lz4 decompression crash
